# 🎤 Pitch Please — Cheat Sheet  
**How to turn any presentation from “OK” to *unforgettable*.**

## 🚀 Three Pillars of a Great Presentation

| Pillar | Focus |
|--------|--------|
| 🎨 **Design That Works** | Fonts, colors, visuals, code, data. |
| 🧠 **Storytelling That Sticks** | Hook → Problem → Solution → Why → Ask. |
| 💥 **Delivery That Inspires** | Presence, confidence, body language. |

> Good slides do **not** make a great presenter —  
> a great presenter makes the audience *care*.

## 🎨 I. Design That Works

| Topic | Key Tip | Details |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Text** | The audience reads faster than you speak. | Avoid walls of text and bullet death 💀 (Death by bullets). |
| **Fonts** | **BIGGER IS BETTER.** | Large titles, clean hierarchy, consistent alignment. |
| **Visuals** | A strong image can replace 40 seconds of talking. | Color = emotion (Green → success, Red → warning). |
| **Data & Numbers** | Choose *one number* you want them to remember. | Graphs should explain themselves *before* you speak. |
| **Code on Slides** | Code is **proof**, not the story. | Use monospaced font, highlight, show less code. |
| **Slide Layout** | One idea per slide. | Remove everything that doesn’t serve the message. |
| **"About Me" Slide** | Build trust fast. | Name + expertise + credibility + CTA. |

## 🧠 II. Storytelling That Sticks

> “People may forget what you said,  
> but they will never forget how you made them feel.” — *Maya Angelou*

### ✅ 10-Minute Pitch Structure

| Time | Stage | What to deliver |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 0–1 min | **The Hook** | Shocking fact, question, personal story. |
| 1–3 min | **The Problem** | Define pain — make them *feel* it. |
| 3–6 min | **The Solution** | Core message — what’s the insight? |
| 6–8 min | **Why Now / Why You** | Proof, credibility, urgency. |
| 8–10 min | **The Ask** | CTA — what should happen next? |

### 🔥 Hook types

- ❓ **Question Hook:** "What if your code could... talk back?"
- 😠 **Pain Hook:** "Ever broke production on a Friday?"
- 🧙 **Story Hook:** "Two years ago... I almost deleted the main DB."
- ⚡ **Shock Hook:** "90% of presentations fail in the first minute."
- 🔮 **Future Hook:** "Imagine slides reacting to your audience."
- 😂 **Humor Hook:** "No live animals in this demo. Promise."

## 💥 III. Delivery That Inspires

- Speak **slow**, pause often, look at the room — not the screen.
- Dress like you already *belong* on that stage.
- Practice until you can no longer get it wrong.

**Takeaway Checklist:**

- Keep it simple → 1–2 sentences per idea.
- Define the 3 things the audience should remember.
- Turn every insight into an **action**.

## 🧩 Bonus: Slide Design Rules

### ✅ DO:
- Use **1 idea per slide**
- Use **big, readable typography**
- Use visuals that **carry meaning**, not decoration
- Remove anything that doesn’t support the message

### ❌ DON’T:
- Read from the slides aloud
- Dump paragraphs of text
- Show code that is too small to read
- Use bullet lists for everything (“Death by bullets 💀”)

#### Slide Heuristic (The Rule of 3)

> If the slide works without you → too much text.  
> If YOU need the slide to explain → not enough clarity.  
> If both work together → you nailed it.
